to Joyce, David

Dear Joyce,

 

I hope this message finds you doing well.  I wanted to remind you to that by the *start* of reading period (December 6, 2018) at the latest, you should submit: i) the final paper and ii) a half-page summary of your independent study work, to your faculty advisor and Bilal (upon which your faculty advisor will email leveretthousedean@fas.harvard.edu your final grade of either ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’). 

 

Wishing you a great rest of the term!

 

Kind regards,

Kim
