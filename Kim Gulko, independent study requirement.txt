Hi Dr. Malik, Professor Parkes:

I hope this email finds you well! Attached please find my final report and half-page summary of my fall-term independent study. While my paper includes the larger findings of my analyses, I've also attached the Jupyter notebook if you would like a closer look at the Python code used in this project. 

Also, I just want to thank you again for letting me pursue this project and better understand various analytical techniques which can be used throughout the modeling process to make it more accurate, robust, and efficient, as well as allowing me to better engage with the material at my internship this semester.

Best,
Joyce

Dear Joyce,

I hope this message finds you doing well.  I wanted to remind you to that by the *start* of reading period (December 6, 2018) at the latest, you should submit: i) the final paper and ii) a half-page summary of your independent study work, to your faculty advisor and Bilal (upon which your faculty advisor will email leveretthousedean@fas.harvard.edu your final grade of either ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’). 

 
Wishing you a great rest of the term!

 
Kind regards,

Kim
